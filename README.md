📊 Churn Prediction Project 🚀
Welcome to the Churn Prediction project! This project is all about predicting whether customers will churn (i.e., stop using a product or service). We're using machine learning magic to analyze customer data and identify those most at risk. Read on to discover how we built, trained, and evaluated our models!

Project Overview 👓
This project aims to:

Identify customer churn: Churn means a customer is likely to leave a service. We'll predict who will stay and who will go.
Compare different models: We use a variety of machine learning algorithms to see which ones perform the best at predicting churn.
Handle data imbalance: In most datasets, more customers stay than leave, so we apply clever techniques to deal with this imbalance.
Our process is broken down into a few steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing
Model Training and Evaluation
Model Comparison
Result Visualization
Installation 📥
To run this project locally, make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn lazypredict xgboost imblearn
Data Overview 📈
The dataset we're using has 20,000 rows and 55 columns, including various customer attributes like:

age,
gender,
account_balance,
subscription_level, etc.
Our goal is to predict the target variable: churn (whether the customer churned or not).

Preprocessing 🔧
Steps:
Handling Missing Values: We drop or impute missing data.
Feature Encoding: Using label encoding for categorical features like gender and subscription_level.
Oversampling & Undersampling: Since we have more non-churning customers, we balance the dataset using methods like:
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
ADASYN
Random Undersampling
Tomek Links
Visualizations to Include:
Class Distribution: Pie charts before and after balancing the dataset, showing how SMOTE/ADASYN changes the proportion of churners vs. non-churners.
Models 🧠
We’ve tested several machine learning models to predict churn:

Logistic Regression 🤖
Random Forest Classifier 🌲
Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🧮
XGBoost ⚡
LazyPredict (for rapid model comparison) 🏎️
We also used a Stacking Classifier, combining multiple models to get better predictions.

Visualizations to Include:
Model Comparison Bar Chart: A bar chart comparing accuracy scores for each model.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix for each model showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Evaluation & Results 🏆
Metrics:
Accuracy: How often the model gets it right.
Precision: When the model says "churn," how often is it correct?
Recall: How good is the model at finding all the churners?
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
We use train_test_split to divide the data into training and test sets, and run cross-validation to ensure our results are consistent.

Conclusion 🎉
At the end of this project, you’ll:

Understand which model is the best for churn prediction.
See how various techniques (like oversampling) impact model performance.
Gain insights into customer behavior through the visualizations.
Best Model
Based on our evaluation, we found that the [Best Model Name] achieved the highest accuracy and F1 score! 🎯
